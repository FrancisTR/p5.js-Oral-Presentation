		<h3>Processing</h3>
		<p>
			Processing is an open-source IDE that is also serves as a creative tool that is made by the the same people that made p5.js. Both share mostly the same purpose and have similar functions like setup() and draw(). The main difference being that it is Java-based programming environment whereas p5.js is a JavaScript library.
			<h4>When should you use processing over p5.js</h4>
			Unlike p5.js Processing is not a well suited for web application, it is optimized for desktop graphics, which can be preferrable for graphics-intensive applications. Additionally Processing has built-in support for Arduino implementation.

		<h3>three.js</h3>
		<p>
			three.js is a JavaScript library to create 3D visualizations in web browsers. The workflow and learning curve of three.js is different from p5.js since you need some understanding of 3D graphic concepts.
			<h4>When should you use three.js over p5.js</h4>
			Obviously, you should use three.js if you would like to make 3D visuals. With three.js, you can work with WebGL features, allowing you to have optimized performance.
