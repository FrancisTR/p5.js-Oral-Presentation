- Makes coding simplier and efficient when it comes to creating art (Creative Coding).
- Demonstate of creating simple shapes using Vanilla JavaScript VS. p5.js.

### Where is it used (and why)?
p5.js is mainly used in academic and web design contexts. The majority of usescases are for unique and thoughtful audio/visual projects built with code.

**Creative Coding**
For those learning programming, this framework helps the focus be on what to code instead of how to code it.

**Presentation Medium**
Websites designed with p5.js make for a neat tool to present on a particular topic in a unique way.
